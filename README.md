 What are Genetic Algorithms ?

Genetic Algorithm are search and optimization algortihm which are based on natural selection procedure. It is Survival of the fittest, in compuptation field, by survival of the fittest we mean fetching the best possible solution for the current parameters. Genetic Algorithm generates all possible solution randomly selected based upon the formula deviced for the problem(NOTE: Knowledge of converting problem statement into formulae is required).
